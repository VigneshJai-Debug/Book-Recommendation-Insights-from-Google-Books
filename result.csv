Kelleher","Brendan Tierney","","","MIT Press","2018-04-13","A concise introduction to the emerging field of data science, explaining its evolution, relation to machine learning, current uses, data infrastructure issues, and ethical challenges. The goal of data science is to improve decision making through the analysis of data. Today data science determines the ads we see online, the books and movies that are recommended to us online, which emails are filtered into our spam folders, and even how much we pay for health insurance. This volume in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series offers a concise introduction to the emerging field of data science, explaining its evolution, current uses, data infrastructure issues, and ethical challenges. It has never been easier for organizations to gather, store, and process data. Use of data science is driven by the rise of big data and social media, the development of high-performance computing, and the emergence of such powerful methods for data analysis and modeling as deep learning. Data science encompasses a set of principles, problem definitions, algorithms, and processes for extracting non-obvious and useful patterns from large datasets. It is closely related to the fields of data mining and machine learning, but broader in scope. This book offers a brief history of the field, introduces fundamental data concepts, and describes the stages in a data science project. It considers data infrastructure and the challenges posed by integrating data from multiple sources, introduces the basics of machine learning, and discusses how to link machine learning expertise with real-world problems. The book also reviews ethical and legal issues, developments in data regulation, and computational approaches to preserving privacy. Finally, it considers the future impact of data science and offers principles for success in data science projects.","ISBN_13","9780262347037","True","True","282","BOOK","Computers","","","NOT_MATURE","True","1.3.3.0.preview.3","False","False","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UlpVDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UlpVDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.co.in/books?id=UlpVDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=data+science&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UlpVDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UlpVDwAAQBAJ","IN","FOR_SALE","True","1195.34","INR","597.67","INR","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UlpVDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-UlpVDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","1","listPrice","1195340000","INR","IN","PARTIAL","True","False","ALLOWED","True","http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Data_Science-sample-epub.acsm?id=UlpVDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api","True","http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Data_Science-sample-pdf.acsm?id=UlpVDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api","http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=UlpVDwAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","SAMPLE","False","This volume in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series offers a concise introduction to the emerging field of data science, explaining its evolution, current uses, data infrastructure issues, and ethical challenges."

It is the future of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and a necessity of the future to make things easier and more productive. In simple terms, data science is the discovery of data or uncovering hidden patterns (such as complex behaviors, trends, and inferences) from data. Moreover, Big Data analytics/data analytics are the analysis mechanisms used in data science by data scientists. Several tools, such as Hadoop, R, etc., are used to analyze this large amount of data to predict valuable information and for decision-making. Note that structured data can be easily analyzed by efficient (available) business intelligence tools, while most of the data (80% of data by 2020) is in an unstructured form that requires advanced analytics tools. But while analyzing this data, we face several concerns, such as complexity, scalability, privacy leaks, and trust issues. Data science helps us to extract meaningful information or insights from unstructured or complex or large amounts of data (available or stored virtually in the cloud). Data Science and Data Analytics: Opportunities and Challenges covers all possible areas, applications with arising serious concerns, and challenges in this emerging field in detail with a comparative analysis/taxonomy. FEATURES Gives the concept of data science, tools, and algorithms that exist for many useful applications Provides many challenges and opportunities in data science and data analytics that help researchers to identify research gaps or problems Identifies many areas and uses of data science in the smart era Applies data science to agriculture, healthcare, graph mining, education, security, etc. Academicians, data scientists, and stockbrokers from industry/business will find this book useful for designing optimal strategies to enhance their firm’s productivity.","ISBN_13","9781000423228","True","True","517","BOOK","Computers","","","NOT_MATURE","False","preview-1.0.0","False","False","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cnGNEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cnGNEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.co.in/books?id=cnGNEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=data+science&hl=&cd=18&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cnGNEQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cnGNEQAAQBAJ","IN","FOR_SALE","True","5428","INR","5428","INR","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cnGNEQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-cnGNEQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","1","listPrice","5428000000","INR","IN","PARTIAL","True","False","ALLOWED","True","http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Data_Science_and_Data_Analytics-sample-epub.acsm?id=cnGNEQAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api","True","http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Data_Science_and_Data_Analytics-sample-pdf.acsm?id=cnGNEQAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api","http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=cnGNEQAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","SAMPLE","False","Academicians, data scientists, and stockbrokers from industry/business will find this book useful for designing optimal strategies to enhance their firm’s productivity."
